# MicroForge ⚙️

***LLM-Powered Automation for Modern Microservice Architectures***

---

## 🧭 Overview

**MicroForge** is a developer-focused platform that automatically generates, validates, and deploys microservices from high-level descriptions using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **OpenAPI contracts**. It combines the runtime efficiency of **Rust** with the flexibility of **Python agents** to enable rapid, scalable development of robust service-based systems.

The project is built to explore and develop skills across:
- Rust backend development (Axum, Tokio)
- Distributed systems and microservice design
- Software architecture and automation
- Web development with OpenAPI-first philosophy
- Multi-agent systems and AI orchestration using Python

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Automate microservice development** from user intent (prompt) to production-ready service.
- **Use OpenAPI as the source of truth**, enabling clear contracts and safe integrations.
- **Generate and evolve services using LLM-powered agents** that handle API spec creation, code scaffolding, validation, and CI suggestions.
- **Design a central Rust-based system** that efficiently runs and connects services using both synchronous (HTTP/gRPC) and asynchronous (event-based) communication models.
- **Improve developer productivity** by reducing manual work in CRUD setup, routing, and boilerplate orchestration logic.

## 🔧 What This Application Will Do

1. **Accept high-level user input** describing a desired microservice (e.g., “Create a service to manage products with SKU, name, and stock”).
2. **Use an LLM agent to generate an OpenAPI contract** defining the API.
3. **Automatically scaffold a Rust microservice** using frameworks like Axum and annotate it with `utoipa` or similar tools to match the OpenAPI spec.
4. **Run automated tests and contract validation**, using tools like `cargo test` and Schemathesis.
5. **Optionally containerize and register the service** for communication within a distributed system.
6. **Support real-time (sync) and event-based (async) service interactions**, improving runtime responsiveness and system scalability.

## 📋 Requirements (High-Level)

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Runtime Backend | **Rust**, using Axum + Tokio |
| API Contracts | **OpenAPI 3.0** |
| LLM Orchestration | **Python**, using OpenAI or local LLM APIs |
| Agent Framework | Modular Python scripts or threaded orchestration |
| Testing | `cargo test`, `schemathesis`, or contract-driven test tools |
| CI/CD (Optional) | GitHub Actions or Docker pipelines |

---
## 🛣️ Next Steps

1. **Initialize a Rust workspace** with basic Axum setup.
2. **Set up Python CLI** to handle user prompts and agent logic.
3. **Integrate OpenAPI generation & Rust code templating** based on specs.
4. **Define communication model** (sync/async) and inter-service handling.
5. **Develop one full cycle**: prompt → spec → service → test → deploy.
6. **Iterate to build service registry and LLM feedback/refinement loop**.

## 🧠 LLM Agent Design

### 🧾 Spec Agent
- Input: User prompt
- Output: OpenAPI 3.0 spec
- Tools: LLM + OpenAPI template knowledge

### 🛠️ Code Agent
- Input: OpenAPI spec
- Output: Rust Axum project (annotated)
- Tasks:
  - Generate routes, handlers
  - Inject `utoipa` annotations
  - Setup basic CRUD logic

### 🧪 Validation Agent
- Input: Rust service
- Output: Test report
- Tasks:
  - Run `cargo check`, `cargo test`
  - Run `schemathesis` against OpenAPI
  - Return errors to refine code if needed

---

## 📌 Key Constraints & Assumptions

- The user input must be structured enough for reliable LLM spec generation.
- All services follow OpenAPI contract-first principles.
- Rust is the execution runtime; Python is only used for orchestration logic.
- Stateless service design is preferred for parallel execution and scale-out.
